# User Testing #2 Script
Things the test administrator may want to watch for have been included in _italics_ under the corresponding step.

In addition to general functionality and navigation, we wanted to test some specific scenarios. These scenarios are as follows,
with their corresponding steps where they are tested:
 - How easy is it to get to a module leaderboard from different places on the website?
	- From the homepage: 'General Navigation': step 2
	- From My grades: 
		- If module is in My grades: 'General Navigation': step 4 and 'Edit': step 2
		- If module is not in My grades: 'General Navigation': step 6
 - From the homepage, does the user prefer Add Grade button in nav or Program Overview?
   - 'Add': Step 1

## Setup
1. Read the welcome message
2. Sign in as the Demo User
	- _Was the demo sign-in button obvious?_

## General Navigation
1. Find the average grades for all the modules
2. Find the highest grade for CM2005
	- _Did they struggle to get to this leaderboard?_
3. Find which modules the Demo User has submitted grades for
	- _Did they get to 'My grades' from either the nav button or the profile icon pop-up menu? If so, which?_
4. See the module leaderboard for one of the Demo User's submitted grades
	- _Did they get there from 'My grades'?_
5. Go to My grades and take note of modules the demo user has submitted a grade for
6. Go to a module leaderboard which Demo User has NOT submitted a grade for
	- _Did they know to go back to home then find program overview?_
7. Go to homepage
	- _What link did they use? home button, logo, or 'Gradez'?_

## Add
1. From the homepage, add a grade for CM2005
	- _Which Add grade button did they use? Button above table or in nav?_
2. Go to leaderboard for CM2005 and ensure grade is correct.
	- _How did they get there? Homepage->Leaderboard or My grades->leaderboard?_
3. Go to the leaderboard for Algorithms and Data Structures I
	- _Did they struggle to get to this leaderboard?_
4. Enter a grade for Algorithms and Data Structures I

## Edit
1. Having entered a grade for Algorithms and Data Structures I, change the session, grade, and privacy setting.
2. Visit the leaderboard for Algorithms and Data Structures I to verify changes
	- _How did they get there? Did they backtrack to homepage or did they realize there is a link in My grades?_

## Sign out
1. Sign-out
	- _Did they have trouble finding the sign-out link?_
