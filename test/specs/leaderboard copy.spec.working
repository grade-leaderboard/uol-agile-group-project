## Check that grades are sorted by timestamp when tied
These tests are done on CM3070.
This relies on the database being manually reset so that Bob's grade is entered at 70% when the DB is refreshed.
Alice's grade of 71 is manually reset so it was entered in December 2019.
A new grade of 71 should be ranked as a tie with Alice and appear between Alice and Bob on the list.
