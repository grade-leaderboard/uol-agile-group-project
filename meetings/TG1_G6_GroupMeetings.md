## 2020-11-09 - Weekly Working Session

### Agenda

-   Brainstorm constraints of the project
-   Brainstorm ideas
-   Qualify initial ideas
-   Define field of research

### Outcomes

-   The team brainstormed what potential constraints might be. These are documented in the PDF documentation of the project, and include topics such as having a _simple tech stack_ and _drawing inspiration_ from existing solutions.
-   The team conducted a crazy eight exercise, generating around 30 ideas in a short, focused time period. We then each presented the top 3 ideas we each produced, and then collectively voted using "dots".
-   The downselected ideas were further voted upon, and then qualified according to potential impact and and feasibility within the constraints.
-   We agreed on 5 ideas that we could do some further research on until the next session:
    -   Cocktail generator for bartenders
    -   Time tracking for students
    -   Uncluttered recipe sharing
    -   Leaderboard for university grades
    -   Product feedback tool (user voice)

### Actions

-   Answer the following question for your assigned idea @everyone:
    -   What are other methods of accomplishing this task?
    -   Who is the customer?
    -   What are the main pain points today?
    -   What is a potential set of features that would address these pain points?

	- brad noted midterm asks for comparison of our idea against
	existing software. Added https://gpacalculator.io/ linked to
	diagram as an example
-	Discussed understanding of "Teamwork activity and deliverable"
	in Coursera
	-	Are we expected to submit them? Doesn't look like it for the
		midterm, but possibly the final. Should do them.

### Actions
- Review midterm
	- is there anything we have already done
	that we need to alter to fit the requirements?
	- will going though week-by-week generate everything
	we need for the final report? Anything extra needed?
- Do peer review Swot Analysis in week 6
- Document research questions in Miro board

## 2020-11-23 - Weekly Working Session

### Agenda
- Review midterm
- Prepare outline

### Outcomes
Questions related to the mid-term:
- On point 1, are these software deliverables (prototypes etc.) or also other intermediate products (non-software mocks), or does it also include design deliverables such as diagrams?
- On point 3, it seems excessively heavy to have a full formal specification as part of a project proposal
- On point 9, it is unclear if the intention is to create actual prototypes as part of the midterm and what resolution is desired
- In "Aims and Objectives", what is meant by "Goals and Operations"?
We set up a draft midterm document:
- [https://www.overleaf.com/6198856199qtwkjvsmdfhs]

### Actions
- Prepare workshops for Thursday (Point 6) and Monday (Point 5, Survey) @arjunmuralidharan
