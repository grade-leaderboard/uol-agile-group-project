## 2020-11-09 - Weekly Working Session

### Agenda

-   Brainstorm constraints of the project
-   Brainstorm ideas
-   Qualify initial ideas
-   Define field of research

### Outcomes

-   The team brainstormed what potential constraints might be. These are documented in the PDF documentation of the project, and include topics such as having a _simple tech stack_ and _drawing inspiration_ from existing solutions.
-   The team conducted a crazy eight exercise, generating around 30 ideas in a short, focused time period. We then each presented the top 3 ideas we each produced, and then collectively voted using "dots".
-   The downselected ideas were further voted upon, and then qualified according to potential impact and and feasibility within the constraints.
-   We agreed on 5 ideas that we could do some further research on until the next session:
    -   Cocktail generator for bartenders
    -   Time tracking for students
    -   Uncluttered recipe sharing
    -   Leaderboard for university grades
    -   Product feedback tool (user voice)

    -   What are other methods of accomplishing this task?
    -   Who is the customer?
    -   What are the main pain points today?
    -   What is a potential set of features that would address these pain points?
