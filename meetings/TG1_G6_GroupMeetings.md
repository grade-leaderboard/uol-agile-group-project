## 2020-11-23 - Weekly Working Session

### Agenda
- Review midterm
- Prepare outline

### Outcomes
Questions related to the mid-term:
- On point 1, are these software deliverables (prototypes etc.) or also other intermediate products (non-software mocks), or does it also include design deliverables such as diagrams?
- On point 3, it seems excessively heavy to have a full formal specification as part of a project proposal
- On point 9, it is unclear if the intention is to create actual prototypes as part of the midterm and what resolution is desired
- In "Aims and Objectives", what is meant by "Goals and Operations"?
We set up a draft midterm document:
- [https://www.overleaf.com/6198856199qtwkjvsmdfhs]

### Actions
- Prepare workshops for Thursday (Point 6) and Monday (Point 5, Survey) @arjunmuralidharan

- Success criteria documented below


### Actions
- Refine project plan
- Continue write-up of draft report until Thursday 

#### Success Criteria

Strategic Goals:
- __Reach__: The tool is used by 5% of all students enrolled in the programme defined as distinct users who have submitted grades
- __Coverage__: At least five grades submitted for each module
- __Repeat__: 30% of students capture at least two grades across two distinct terms
- __Adoption__: The tool is adopted by at least 5 other institutions
- __App Store Ratings__: Long-term, we would want users to rate our product with at least 4 stars

P0 Goals:
- 2%
- 2 grades for each module
- 10% repeat
- Adoption: 1 (uol)
- no app store ratings as no mobile app


## 2020-12-10 - Weekly Check-In Session
### Agenda
- Discuss Status
- Discuss aims and goals
- Review success criteria and KPIs

### Status
- Alex and Arjun appologized for not having "review ready" content for todays meeting

### Outcomes
- Discussed aims and usability goals below 
- Revised success criteria and KPIs below

### Actions
- Continue write-up of draft report until Monday, try to have your parts ready for review on Sunday (Arjun, Alex, Hayato)
- Try to schedule another check-in on Sunday usind Doodle (Bret)

### Aims
- Possible commercial goals were discussed and dismissed due to etical and data privacy concerns. We want to remain accessible for all students and guarantee strong privacy and their full control over grade data.
- Having free and open-source project, allows students to contribute and improve the tool they use 
- Donations (sponsorship) and non-intrusive adds were discussed as a way to support project running cost. GitHub Sponsor mechanism would be used for donations from students, alumni and organizations, while adds would be used as last resort.  

### Possible usability goals
- Time required for first grade entered - Signup-to-entry
- Time to review of main dashboard with grade comparison - Signin-to-dashboard

### Revised Success Criteria

Here is the suggested revision of the medium term and MVP goals:

Medium term goals:
- __Reach__: The tool is used by 5% of all students enrolled in the programme defined as distinct users who have submitted grades. Total population of students enrolled in the programme is derived from the number of students registered in main channel of the collaboration app provided by the university.
> We may need to revise the way we count the total population of students in a programme as we go since accounts of students that leav the university may linger in the tool.
- __Coverage__: 100% of modules have enough submitted grades for meaningfull comparison. Minimum number of grades for meaningfull comparison is 5.
> It was not clear if the coverage relates to grades or modules. Revised definition makes it about the modules.
- __Repeat__: 30% of returning students. Returning students are those that capture at least two grades across two distinct terms.
- __Adoption__: The tool is adopted by at least 5 different programmes
- __App Ratings__: Long-term, we would want users to rate our app with at least 4 stars

P0 (MVP) Goals:
- __Reach__: The tool is used by **2%** of all students enrolled in the programme.
- __Coverage__: **66%** of modules have enough submitted grades for meaningfull comparison
- __Repeat__: **10%** returning students
- __Adoption__: **1** programme (BSc CS @ UoL)
- __App Ratings__: No app store ratings as we launch MVP with progressiwe web app

## 2020-12-21 - Weekly Working Session
### Agenda
- Discuss Sections 1 and 6
- Go over survey results
- Find opportunities to iterate

### Outcomes
- Discussed the wireframe and storyboard submissions.
- Team agreed to some additional wireframes for a login page, some additional common elements like an app logo. Brad realized that the initial wireframes have missed a leaderboard wireframe and the team developed that interactively through screen share.
- Reviewed the storyboards and discussed specifically the character choices. Team decided that no further changes needed to be made to the storyboards.
- Decided usability goals do belong in section 1. We can define them here and then add them as another category to P0 and strategic goals where maybe P0 is meeting 75% of usability goals and Strategic goal is to meet 100% of usability goals
- Survey results:
  - anonymity is key

### Actions
-  Wireframes (Brad): Leaderboard to be cleaned up and email login page to be cleaned up. App icon to be updated on all the wireframes.
- Blair will add survey results and analysis to report (after section 3.3.1 - Key research questions)
- Alex will work on section 1 and 6
  - Add usability goals/success criteria
- Reaffirmed ability to meet as planned during holidays for the next few weeks but prepared to communicate asyncrhonously on slack since things will likely come up

# 2020-1-21 - Weekly Working Session
### Agenda

- Discuss ways we can improve development process

### Outcomes
- Brad is compiling feedback and iterating on wireframes
- Alex added fake authentication and permission middleware, and projects his submit grade story will be done by tomorrow
- Hayato finished personal grades page but will revise to avoid conflict with Alex's database scheme
- Blair is partially done with edit grades story
- Weighed pros/cons of trunk development. Alex suggested trunk development might work better.

### Actions
